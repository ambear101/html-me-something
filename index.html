				<h1>Rocky Mountain National Park</h1>
				<p>Outside of computer programming and gaming, I am an avid hiker. Each year I try to take a trip out west to Colorado and Utah.</p>
				<p>My favorite hikes at Rocky Mountain National Park are the Nymph, Dream, and Emerald lake hike, The Pool &amp Cub Lake, and Gem Lake through Lumpy Ridge.
				Each of these hikes are over 3 miles and can easily be done in a day. I believe all of these hikes also offer the best views in the park.</p>

				<h2>Nymph, Dream, and Emerald Lake</h2>

				<p>This hike is around 3.5 miles round trip, making it a very easy day hike. The change in elevation is the only issue I have ever had attempting this hike.
Personally I am prone to altitude sickness, and have to take some time to acclimate myself to the new elevation every time I attempt to hike in Colorado. TheNymph, Dream, and 
Emerald Lake hike has the best views in the park, and the climb up to each lake allows you to look down on the rest of the park.

				<h3>The Pool &amp Cub Lake</h3>

				<p>The hike up to cub lake is an easier hike that the three lakes hike, and is only 4.8 miles round trip. This hike also changes in elevation, and the trail becomes
narrow in spots when climbing a part of the mountain. Many people choose to take this hike a bit later in the morning to have lunch at cub lake. Due to this, the chipmunks and 
squirrels are very comfortable with getting close to people in an attempt to steal food.</p>

				<h4>Gem Lake through Lumpy Ridge</h4>

				<p>The hike for Gem Lake is 3.5 miles round trip so it is a shorter trip. The view is beautiful so we do spend a bit of time on the shore of the lake, just taking
in the view. The hike is one of the easier hikes in the park, so it is very popular.

				<h5>Honorable Mentions</h5>

					<h6>Bryce Canyon, UT</h6>

					<p>This picture does not do justice to how overwhelming these canyons are in person. For some reference, to the right of the canyon is a road which had a few jeeps driving 
along the canyons. There is a hike around some ridges above the canyons, however it is along clifs that are several hundreds of feet high. We decided to only walk a few hundred feet along 
the hiking trail, as it does get a bit perilous in places. You can get some great views just driving up to the overlook without taking any of the trail as well.</p>

				<section>
			
					<h6>Arches National Park, UT</h6>
					
						<figure>

					<p>The most famous arch at the park is Delicate Arch, however it has a constant stream of visitors. I enjoy every hike through arches, and there are many arches besides
	the iconic Delicate Arch. My favorite hike at the park is the Dark Angel trail which is almost 5 miles long. The hike to the Dark Angel requires some climbing over an arch as well as some 
	trees. It's a very popular hike at the park, so I do recommend going early if you plan to hike the trail.</p>
